    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p> Hello, I'm Brandon Collins. My journey into the tech world began with a focus on avoiding coding through HTML, CSS, and CMS platforms. However, my fascination with JavaScript and the rapid evolution of development tools led me to embrace coding fully. Now, I'm dedicated to becoming a full-stack software engineer, with a keen interest in data storage, analysis, and 3D rendering. My goal is to leverage these skills to create impactful web solutions and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.</p>
